## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Link Traversal-based Query Processing (LTQP) is a promising approach for querying highly decentralized environments. It executes queries without prior knowledge of the data, discovering data sources dynamically.
<!-- Need         -->
During LTQP, engines can prioritize links likely to be relevant to the query, enhancing query execution speed. 
However, assessing the algorithmic performance of these systems is challenging due to various compounding factors during query execution. 
<!-- Task         -->
Therefore, researchers need a metric that accurately measures the marginal effectiveness of link prioritization algorithms in LTQP engines.
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper, we introduce initial steps towards defining such a metric, outlining the challenges and potential extensions of the proposed metric.
<!-- Findings     -->
Our findings show that..
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This metric allows us to clearly evaluate link prioritization performance and paves the way for easily assessing the effectiveness of future link prioritization algorithms.
