## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

1. Metric gives further insight into algorithmic performance of link traversal-based query engines <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Does it? Because it's not apparent to me.</span>, facilitates comparisons between engines (How should I show this? If I can't show it should I just remove it? <span class="comment" data-author="RT">Don't think it's needed to prove this.</span>), and gives future work a goal to work towards.
2. Future work is a significantly more extensive benchmark 
3. Real world usage of LTQP will include http request latency, which can influence the optimal traversal path in terms of total time spent dereferencing documents.
